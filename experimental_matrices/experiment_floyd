Factors: |V|, size of graph                 Levels: ( 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 )
         s  , sparsity of graph                     ( .05, .1, .15, .2, .25, .3 ) more?

         For cpp: dense and coord list representations

Design points: Full factorial

input:   boolean matrix representing the graph

metrics: wall time (ms)
         Only measure actual compuation time if at all possible.

Possible contamination: How to remove time to construct matrix from running time?
                        How to measure futhark with sufficient accuracy?

If I dont slack off: Verify implementation from experiment results
